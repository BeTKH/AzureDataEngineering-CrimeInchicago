# ExploratoryAnalysis.py - script to do EDA (exploratory data analysis) on the two primary data sets for the project.  Use pandas_profiling and exprt to <repo_root>\ingestion_analysis.

# Note - Some data sources may have multiple files that you will use.  There is  likely a primary dataset with the most of the data; target that primary dataset for this analysis.

# This file can be developed using Python Interactive in VS Code or as a straight script.
